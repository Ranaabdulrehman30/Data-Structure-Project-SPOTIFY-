# Data-Structure-Project-SPOTIFY-
C++ based Spotify Project using Data Structures

CS-221 Project

“SPOTIFY”

Project by: Rana Abdul Rehman [2020410]

The following project would mimic a very famous media player app known as “spotify”, which is very common among youth for music playing. In this project the user will be displayed a screen similar to the screenshot attached on the side as he/she runs the code.

In the following project various data structures will be used such as circular and doubly linked list, stack, queues, arrays, trees/graph. The following functionalities would be included in the final project:

1. Add New Song

2. Delete Song

3. Display Entered Playlist

4. Total Songs

5. Search Song

6. Play Song

7. Recently Played List

8. Last Played

9. Sorted playlist

10. Add From File

11. Most played songs (trees)

11. Suggested songs (using graph and tree)

12. Will give you your top 5 played artists.

This is a rough draft of the Project, I will try my best to make it more functional such as to connect it to a database and then give user an option to first create an account then login to access the above mentioned functionalities.

So far I plan to implement the following functionalities using the following approaches: (these may be tentative approaches)

For adding, deleting and searching of the songs, typical function of a linked list will be used as (insert, delete, pop, search). To create a playlist and to actually store songs in it, doubly linked list would be used so that the user gets an option to play the next or the previous song.

All the songs played will then be stored in a queue or stack so that the user gets the option to listen to the last played or the first song. Circular linked list will be used to make sure that user can play any song in a loop. To implement the functionality of most played song, suggested song, top artists Trees and Graphs will be used in an algorithm which would sort the songs on their count (played time). Trees will help to maintain the hierarchy of the artists and songs whereas graphs will help in representing the relationship among the user likeness and the genre of the song. Various different algorithms will be used to implement those functionalities as well. File I/O will be used so that all the data is stored and can be used later on.

Data Type used would be the following:

· String for song name

· String for Artist name

· String for Genre of the song

· Integer for Number of the song

· Integer for Duration and count of the songs

All of the above mentioned Functions, approaches and the datatypes might be different in the actual project as I will try my best to make it as optimal and memory friendly as possible and might come up with a different approach to implement a given problem.
